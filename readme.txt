Objective: Science is blessing for human we all know that. Human have used science to innovation, analysis, better life style what not. So, purpose is not different from that. We intend to make our life much flawless with this system. People can easily save their precious time with this system. Furthermore, assure their home security. They can protect the value asset with this system. Also they can avoid heavy causalities. It’s all in all one pack to home management and security.

Required Components: These following parts and tools are required for building this project
• Arduino UNO
• LCD Display
• Keypad (4*3)
• Finger print sensor
• PIR Sensor
• Flame Sensor
• IR Obstacle Sensor
• Buzzer
• Wire (male to male, male to female, female to female)
• Lipo Nano 1100mAh
• Lipo Battery Charger
• Potentiometer
• Fan motor
• Propeller
• LED
• Bluetooth module/wifi module
• 4 Channel 12V Relay Board Module

Working Procedure: The basic components that react to the input are
• Arduino UNO
Controls and connect all the components together.
• LCD display
To show the message of current status
• Keypad
To provide password for locking door.
• PIR sensor
Senses any movement of unwanted intruder.
• Finger print sensor
Get the finger print for locking door.
• Bluetooth module/wifi module.
Wireless connection to control fan/light etc.
• 4 Channel 12V Relay Board Module
Power Distribution.

Conclusion: The sense of security and peace you gain with an alarm system is perhaps the greatest benefit of all. Next to being safe, the confidence of feeling safe will help you be a more productive, healthy, and focused person. When the value of security is elevated to the top of the collective priorities, it becomes a meta-frame, a reference point in relation to which other aspects of social life are articulated and organized. Adding a security system to our home gives us an extra layer of defense against any potential intruders
